Before we get into the problem, let's talk about what IPv6 and Dynamic PD. Imagine the internet as a giant city. In this city, every house, every store, every office has a unique address. This address is like an IP address, which is how devices on the internet are identified and can communicate with each other.

In the past, the city used IPv4 addresses. These addresses were like street addresses, and they worked well for a while. Bust as the city grew, there weren't enough street addresses to go around. This made it difficult for new devices to get connected to the internet.

## IPv6: A Next-Level Addressing Revolution

IPv6 is like a new addressing system for the city on steroids. It's like using a combination of street addresses, postal codes, and GPS coordinates to make sure that every every device has a unique and identifiable address. 

While IPv4 had a limited number of 4.3 billion addresses (4,294,967,296, to be exact), IPv6 is practically limitless. It's like expanding from a quaint village to an intergalactic empire, ensuring every toaster, smartphone, and interstellar spaceship gets its unique code.

## Dynamic  PD: The Shape-Shifting Sidekick

Dynamic PD is like the magical real estate agent of the digial world. When you move to a new house, you don't have to get a new street address. Instead, you just tell the postal service your new address, and they will start delivering your mail there. Dynamic PD works the same way. It allows devices to get new IP addresses without having to go through a lot of hassle.

Now let's break down how IPv6 works from both the perspective of an home nework and of an Internet Service Provider:

## IPv6 from the Home Network Side:

1. Router Configuration:
    The home router receives a dynamic IPv6 prefix
