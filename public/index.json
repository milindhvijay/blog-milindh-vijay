[{"categories":null,"contents":"A Software Developer\u0026rsquo;s Take: Coding, Tech Shenanigans, and a Dash of Ranting. Hello readers! This is my first ever blog post. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to start sharing my thoughts and perspectives with you all. As I begin this blogging journey, I wanted to give you an idea of the types of topics I plan to cover.\nSoftware Development and Technology As a software engineer, I will likely focus many posts on software development and technology in general. I find these subjects fascinating and enjoy learning and writing about things like coding languages, AI, cybersecurity, and innovations in tech. Expect to see posts diving into these areas from an engineer\u0026rsquo;s point of view.\nIntersections of Technology and Other Fields Beyond pure technology, I also want to explore the intersection of software and other disciplines. How is technology influencing fields like healthcare, education, transportation and more? How can software help connect ideas across different industries? These cross-disciplinary questions energize me.\nEconomics, Finance, and Business In addition to software, I intend to write about economics, finance and business. As both a software engineer and someone interested in markets, I want to learn and discuss how technology is affecting various economic sectors, financial systems, and company operations. There is a deep relationship between the digital and financial worlds.\nBroader Societal Impacts As a citizen concerned about the world, I plan to share my thoughts on broader social and political matters too, especially as they relate to my country and region. The technology we build does not exist in isolation - it\u0026rsquo;s important to examine the wider impacts on people and communities.\nRants \u0026amp; Ramblings Last but not least, this is my digital therapy couch. Expect rants, random thoughts, and maybe a few unpopular opinions. It\u0026rsquo;s where I let off steam, and hopefully, youâ€™ll join in on the chaos.\n","permalink":"https://blog.milindhvijay.com/posts/first-blog-post/","tags":null,"title":"My First Blog Post"},{"categories":null,"contents":"About Me I\u0026rsquo;m just an ordinary guy who loves building things. Ever since I was a kid, I\u0026rsquo;ve been fascinated by technology and how it can make people\u0026rsquo;s lives better. I still remember taking apart my first computer just to see how it worked inside - my parents weren\u0026rsquo;t too happy about that!\nAs I got older, I knew I wanted to turn my passion into a career in software engineering. I studied computer science in college and was always excited to work on group projects, hackathons, and anything that let me flex my coding skills.\nAfter graduation, I started my professional journey at a startup building large-scale distributed systems. It was exciting to see my code go live and be used by thousands of people! Of course, things didn\u0026rsquo;t always go smoothly - late nights debugging complex problems taught me a lot about resilience.\nThese days, I work on crafting robust backend infrastructure and services. I love optimizing for performance and high availability. Outside of work, I dabble in side projects across web, mobile, and AI. Turns out you can build some pretty cool things with just a laptop and internet connection!\nOn my blog, I hope to share my adventures in technology, as well as chat about other topics I enjoy like economics, philosophy, and ways we can leverage tech for social good. I\u0026rsquo;m far from an expert, but writing helps clarify my own thinking. Hopefully you\u0026rsquo;ll find it interesting too!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see where this journey takes us next. Thanks for reading!\n","permalink":"https://blog.milindhvijay.com/bio/","tags":null,"title":"Bio"}]
