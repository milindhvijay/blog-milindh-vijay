# A Software Developer's Take: Coding, Tech Shenanigans, and a Dash of Ranting.

Hello readers! This is my first ever blog post. I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and perspectives with you all. As I begin this blogging journey, I wanted to give you an idea of the types of topics I plan to cover. 

## Software Development and Technology

As a software engineer, I will likely focus many posts on software development and technology in general. I find these subjects fascinating and enjoy learning and writing about things like coding languages, AI, cybersecurity, and innovations in tech. Expect to see posts diving into these areas from an engineer's point of view.

## Intersections of Technology and Other Fields 

Beyond pure technology, I also want to explore the intersection of software and other disciplines. How is technology influencing fields like healthcare, education, transportation and more? How can software help connect ideas across different industries? These cross-disciplinary questions energize me.

## Economics, Finance, and Business

In addition to software, I intend to write about economics, finance and business. As both a software engineer and someone interested in markets, I want to learn and discuss how technology is affecting various economic sectors, financial systems, and company operations. There is a deep relationship between the digital and financial worlds.

## Broader Societal Impacts

As a citizen concerned about the world, I plan to share my thoughts on broader social and political matters too, especially as they relate to my country and region. The technology we build does not exist in isolation - it's important to examine the wider impacts on people and communities. 

## Rants & Ramblings

Last but not least, this is my digital therapy couch. Expect rants, random thoughts, and maybe a few unpopular opinions. It's where I let off steam, and hopefully, youâ€™ll join in on the chaos.
